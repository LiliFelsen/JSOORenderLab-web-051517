## JS Object Orientation and Rendering Lab

In this lab we will be practicing how to structure our javascript code to follow principles of object orientation, as well as how to render information about our objects on the page.

###  Instructions:

Fork the starter code in this repo.  This lab has no tests, but follow the steps below to continue building out the lab:

 -   Run `open index.html` in your terminal to open the lab in the browser.  Notice that you are able to add items to the shopping list, but the `Add to cart` links next to the items on your list are not yet functional.

 - All current functionality has been coded with jQuery only, but we would like to refactor the starter code (located in index.js) to use object orientation.  Meaning, we should have separate classes for Item, List, and Cart.  These files have been created for you, but are blank.  You will also need to add additional script tags to your index.html in order to load these files.

 -  From a user's perspective, a person should be able to type an item and a price in the input boxes at top, and the item and price should show up on the shopping list (without a page refresh) when the button is clicked.  The user should then be able to click the `Add to cart` link next to the item, which should both add the item to the shopping cart remove that item from the shopping list.
